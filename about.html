<h1><center>OUR VISION</center></h1>
<p style="font-size:40px;"><pre>
India is the blind capital of the world.

15 million people in India are blind, which is 50% of the blind people of the world.
75% of these are cases of avoidable blindness. 
Thanks to the country's acute shortage of optometrists and donated eyes for the treatment of corneal blindness.
153 million people in the country need reading glasses but do not have access to them.
Our country needs 40,000 optometrists. Unfortunately we only have 8,000.
Revolutionize the eyewear industry in India.

Lenskart's aim is to help drop this number marginally in the coming years,
which can be achieved by providing high quality eyewear to millions of Indians at affordable prices,
giving free eye check ups at home and by extending our services to the remote corners of India.</p>


<h1><center>OUR MISSION</center></h1>
<p>
Wow customers by doing something that has never been done before in the eyewear industry. It began with an aim. An aim to provide every Indian access to high-quality designer glasses without shelling out their pocket.We rocked our brains. We broke our backs to come up with a plan that will not just change the way this industry works, 
but also will completely sweep customer off their feet. It can only be achieved if we provide.
